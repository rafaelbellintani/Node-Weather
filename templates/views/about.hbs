            <p>This website was made by Rafael Bellintani (me), to be added to my portfolio, This website works to provide a weather forecast showing the actual description of weather and temperature.
                 I Used the MapBox API to fetch geocode details when a user search for a City or Postal code and uses the geocode data
                 to fetch in Weather Stack API data about forecast in the currently city and display to the user. I used NODE.JS as a javascript runtime,
                 Express to setup a webserver and handlebars as a template engine for express. After that, i added my project in github with the git-scm tool to have a
                 version control and after tests, made deploy to heroku. Sorry for any english mistakes, I'm working on it and i'm always improving! :)</p>
